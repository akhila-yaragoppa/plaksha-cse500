    "\n",
    "Ever want to relive the glory days of your youth and pass secret messages to your friends? Well, here is your chance! But first, here is some vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encryption - the process of obscuring or encoding messages to make them unreadable\n",
    "- Decryption - making encrypted messages readable again by decoding them\n",
    "- Cipher - algorithm for performing encryption and decryption\n",
    "- Plaintext - the original message\n",
    "- Ciphertext - the encrypted message. Note: a ciphertext still contains all of the original message information, even if it looks like gibberish. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Caesar Cipher**\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the Caesar Cipher is to pick an integer and shift every letter of your message by that integer. In other words, suppose the shift is $k$. Then, all instances of the $i^{th}$ letter of the alphabet that appear in the plaintext should become the $(i + k)^{th}$ letter of the alphabet in the ciphertext. You will need to be careful with the case in which $i + k > 26$ (the length of the alphabet).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will treat uppercase and lowercase letters individually, so that uppercase letters are always mapped to an uppercase letter, and lowercase letters are always mapped to a lowercase letter. If an uppercase letter maps to “A”, then the same lowercase letter should map to “a”. Punctuation and spaces should be retained and not changed. For example, a plaintext message with a comma should have a corresponding ciphertext with a comma in the same position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Plaintext|shift|Ciphertext|\n",
    "|---------|-----|----------|\n",
    "|'abcdef'|2|'cdefgh'|\n",
    "|'Hello World!'|4|'Lipps, Asvph!'|\n",
    "|''|any value|''|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes and Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your first experience coding with classes! Get excited! We will have a `Message` class with two subclasses `PlaintextMessage` and `CiphertextMessage`. `Message` contains methods that could be used to apply a cipher to a string, either to encrypt or to decrypt a message (since for Caesar codes this is the same action). `PlaintextMessage` has methods to encode a string using a specified shift value; our class will always create an encoded version of the message, and will have methods for changing the encoding. `CiphertextMessage` contains a method used to decode a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have completed your implementation, you can either create a `CiphertextMessage` instance using an encrypted string that someone provides you and try to decrypt it; or you can encrypt your own `PlaintextMessage` instance, then create a `CiphertextMessage` instance from the encrypted message within the `PlaintextMessage` instance, and try to decrypt it and see if it matches the original plaintext message.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your job will be to fill methods for all three of these classes according to the specifications given in the docstrings**. Please remember that you never want to directly access attributes outside a class - that’s why you have getter and setter methods. Don’t overthink this; a getter method should just return an attribute and a set method should just set an attribute equal to the argument passed in. Although they seem simple, we need these methods in order to make sure that we are not manipulating attributes we shouldn’t be. Directly using class attributes outside of the class itself instead of using getters and setters will result in a point deduction – and more importantly can cause you headaches as you design and implement object class hierarchies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to use recursion in Part B, but you are welcome to. There are a couple of helper functions that we have implemented for you: `load_words` and `is_word`. You may use these in your solution and you do not need to understand them completely, but should read the associated comments. You should read and understand the helper code in the rest of the file and use it to guide your solution. \n",

    "### Part C (15 points): Substitution Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "A better way to hide your messages is to use a substitution cipher. In this approach, you create a hidden coding scheme, in which you substitute a randomly selected letter for each original letter. For the letter “a”, you could pick any of the other 26 letters (including keeping “a”), for the letter “b”, you could then pick any of the remaining 25 letters (other than what you selected for “a”) and so on. You can probably see that the number of possibilities to test if you wanted to decrypt a substitution ciphered message is much larger than for a Caesar cipher (26! compared to 26). So for this problem, we are going to just consider substitution ciphers in which the vowels are encrypted, with lowercase and uppercase versions of a letter being mapped to corresponding letters. (For example, ‘A’ -> ‘O’ then ‘a’->’o’).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes and Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the Caesar cipher, we are going to use classes to explore this idea. We will have a `SubMessage` class with general functions for handling Substitution Messages of this kind. We will also write a class with a more specific implementation and specification, `EncryptedSubMessage`, that inherits from the `SubMessage` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job will be to fill methods for both classes according to the specifications given in the docstrings. Please remember that you never want to directly access attributes outside a class - that’s why you have getter and setter methods. Again, don’t overthink this; a get method should just return a variable and a set method should just set an attribute equal to the parameter passed in. Although they are simple, we need these methods in order to make sure that we are not manipulating attributes we shouldn’t be. Directly using class attributes outside of the class itself instead of using getters and setters will result in a point deduction – and more importantly can cause you headaches as you design and implement object class hierarchies.\n",
