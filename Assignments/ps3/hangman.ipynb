    "#### C. User Input Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You may assume that the user will only guess one character at a time, but the user can choose any number, symbol or letter. Your code should accept capital and lowercase letters as valid guesses! \n",
    "2. If the user inputs anything besides an alphabet (symbols, numbers), tell the user that they can only input an alphabet. Because the user might do this by accident, they should get 3 warnings at the beginning of the game. Each time they enter an invalid input, or a letter they have already guessed, they should lose a warning. If the user has no warnings left and enters an invalid input, they should lose a guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint #1:** Use calls to the input function to get the user’s guess.  \n",
    "        a. Check that the user input is an alphabet\n",
    "        b. If the user does not input an uppercase or lowercase alphabet letter, subtract one warning or one guess. \n",
    "**Hint #2:** you may find the string functions `str.isalpha(‘your string’)` and `str.lower(‘Your String’)` helpful! If you don’t know what these functions are you could try typing `help(str.isalpha)` or `help(str.lower)` to see the documentation for the functions.  \n",
    "**Hint #3:** Since the words in words.txt are lowercase, it might be easier to convert the user input to lowercase at all times and have your game only handle lowercase.\n",

    "5. **Consonants:** If the user inputs a consonant that hasn’t been guessed and the consonant is not in the secret word, the user loses **one** guess if it’s a consonant.\n",
    "6. **Vowels:** If the vowel hasn’t been guessed and the vowel is not in the secret  word, the user loses **two** guesses. Vowels are *a*, *e*, *i*, *o*, and *u*. *y* does not count as a vowel.\n",
